# Axway API-Management Automated

This repository includes a set of sample APIs and API-Gateway policy configurations, just as would be set up for customers if they wanted to automate control of the Axway API-Management platform based on DevOps pipelines, which is of course Axway's clear recommendation.

The following use cases/requirements are illustrated:

- API Design
- APIs as Code
- API Mockup with API-Builder
- API integration with API-Builder
- API Gateway Configuration
- API Gateway Updates

The DevOps pipelines run on top of GitHub actions, but are also implementable with any other technology such as Jenkins or Azure pipelines, as only standard tools such as the APIM CLI, kubectl, etc. are used. 
Some of the use cases, like API builder or API gateway updates, require the API management solution to run in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Git-Example structure

This repository represents an example structure of how one might store the resources needed for the Axway API Management Platform in a version control system. It is primarily about individual APIs, the API gateway configuration incl. policies and settings. This GitHub repository uses GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform, but can be modified accordingly to, for example, Jenkins.

## Setup 

### Service-Provider Setup

The steps listed here are necessary for the API service provider if they want to use all or some of the use cases. For example, if you want to register or modify APIs or change policies.

The following requirements
- Windows or Linux environment (Learn more [System requirements](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/index.html#operating-systems-and-hardware))
- Git client for instance GitHub Desktop
- GitHub account
- Axway Policy Studio installed (Learn more [Install Policy Studio](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/install_policy_studio/index.html))
- npm and Nodes.js installed (Learn more [API Builder Getting Started Guide](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/API_Builder_4x_allOS_en/page/api_builder_getting_started_guide.html))
- [axway cli](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Axway_CLI_allOS_en/page/axway_cli.html)
- [apim-cli](https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apim-cli/wiki/1.-How-to-get-started) installed
- Access to npm repositories
  - You may try to create an API-Builder project with `axway builder init my-project`, which will try to download required packages
- an API-Design Tool for instance Stoplight

### Check-Out

As a first step, the API service provider must check out the repository. The following example:
```
git clone https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/axway-api-management-automated.git
```

Then, the API service provider opens the checked-out repository in its desired development tool, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Use-Cases

This repository represents how the Axway API management platform can be fully automated based on version management and DevOps pipelines. This includes a number of use cases that are presented here.

### APIs as Code

The API as Code approach means that instead of manually configuring their APIs in the system, they define them in the version management system of their choice and register and keep them in sync through a DevOps pipeline in the API management platform.  

Watch this video to see an illustration how to register an API base on version control:  

[![Register API as Code](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zlFDsXnTRyY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zlFDsXnTRyY)

Another apporach is to use the API-Manager Web-UI, configure an API and then use the APIM-CLI to export the configuration:

### API-Design

This use case is about creating a completely new API based on an API-first approach. To do this, you use an API design editor of your choice, design the first version of your API and then register it in the API management platform.

### API Mockup with API-Builder

After you have designed an API, it is a convenient way of the API builder to quickly and easily mock APIs, separating the process between API service and API consumption. 

Before using the API-Builder this video explains how to install and create a first API-Builder project:  
[![Install API-Builder and create a project](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ncU6qz1zf2g/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ncU6qz1zf2g)  

And the following video is now using API-Builder to Mock an API:

### API Integration with API-Builder

Of course, the real strength of the API Builder is not mocking APIs, but various integration scenarios, customizing and optimizing APIs. 

### API Gateway Configuration

The API gateways are controlled by policies, which are configured in Policy Studio and then deployed to the API gateways completely automatically through the DevOps pipelines set up here without any downtime.

### API Gateway Updates

Using DevOps pipelines and a Kubernetes cluster, updating the API management platform is done by a rolling exchange of the corresponding Docker images, which are built by the pipeline and registered with the Kubernetes cluster.
